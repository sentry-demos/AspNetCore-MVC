## Gotchas 

#### Question: Where is ```Sentry.init()```?
\
This demo leverages ASP.NET Core's configuration system. Because of this much of your Sentry config info (dsn etc.) is going to be located in ```appsettings.json```. This allows us to call the ```UseSentry()``` extension method on our webbuilder in ```Program.cs``` without any arguments.

#### Question: How am I setting breadcrumbs without ```SentrySdk.AddBreadcrumb()```?
\
This demo utilizes Sentry's integration with ```Microsoft.Extensions.Logging``` to both set  breadcrumbs and send errors. Your ```appsettings.json``` file configures the minimum log levels that correspond to either a crumb or an event.
